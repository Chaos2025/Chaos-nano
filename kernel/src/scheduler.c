 * @brief Priority-Based Scheduler
 *
 * @details:
 * This is the main function of the whole system.
 * When the chip resets or starts up, it run from the function 'start_kernel()'.
 * Within the main function, hardware initialization is performed,
 * and the hardware devices that need to be activated before the scheduler runs are started.
 * 
 * If the function 'start_kernel()' is called externally, 
 * the board initialization can also be placed before the 'start_kernel()' function is called.
