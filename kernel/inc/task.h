 * @brief   Task's definition
 *
 * @details:
 * The task ID identifies the uniqueness of the task. 
 * The system does not have dynamic memory management.So the task ID is used to 
 * represent both the priority of the task and also serves as the sequence number 
 * for task resources in other subsystems.
 * 
 * There are three types task in the system:
 * - user task:
 *  These tasks are for data processing.
 * - device task:
 *  When a interrupt arrived, it wakes up a specified task for device driver.
 *  Or executing the driver when the timer expires.
 * - idle task: 
 *  The idle task is not take any task ID, and its priority is lowest.
